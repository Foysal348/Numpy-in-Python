## Overview

NumPy (Numerical Python) is an essential Python library that provides:
- Efficient **N-dimensional array objects**
- Mathematical and statistical functions
- High-performance numerical operations

NumPy is widely used for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning workflows in Python. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This repository focuses on **practical learning and examples** using Jupyter notebooks.
